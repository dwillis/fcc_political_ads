<a name="mandated"></a><p class="tip">Mandated stations are those required by new FCC rules to put their political files online. There is no standard form available, so instead stations are uploading their own ad contracts, invoices, rate cards and other documents as PDF files. This rule began Aug. 2, and only applies to ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC affiliates in the top 50 TV markets.</p>
