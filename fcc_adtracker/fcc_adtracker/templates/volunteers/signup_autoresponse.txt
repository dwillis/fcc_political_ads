Thank you for signing up to be a Political Ad Sleuth!

Here are a few reminders and resources to help you unlock political files at your local TV station:

* Download and print this inspection checklist: http://www.freepress.net/files/publicfiles-checklist.pdf

* Sign up for a training (if you haven't completed one) at http://act2.freepress.net/survey/2012_file_inspection_project/

* If you encounter any issues at the stations or have any questions, email: politicaladsleuth@sunlightfoundation.com

The Political Ad Sleuth Project is a collaborative effort led by the Sunlight Foundation, Free Press and the New America Foundation, along with a number of other journalism and open government organizations.
