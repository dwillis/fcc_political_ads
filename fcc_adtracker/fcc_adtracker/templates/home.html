            <p>Use this site to get the latest information on political ads purchased at television stations around the country. These files provide the only information we have on who's behind some of the shadowy groups pouring money into the election. You can sort it by <a href="/political-files/states/">state</a> and individual <a href="/political-files/dmas/">television market</a> or <a href="http://politicaladsleuth.com/search/">search by date</a>. Some of it we have thanks to ProPublicaâ€™s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/free-the-files/">Free the Files</a>. Note: This information <a href="/about/">is not complete</a> but it is the most comprehensive data available. With your help, we're trying to fill the gaps by getting paper files from TV stations and by <a href="http://politicaladsleuth.com/political-files/needs-entry/">entering data</a>.
